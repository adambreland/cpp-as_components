# An example command line for compiling a test executable that does not use the
# Bazel testing environment. The file test/stand_alone_test.cc has since been
# deleted, but this command line shows how dependencies can be included.
# Note that the order of static libraries in the command line is one of the
# two possible linear orderings of dependencies which follow the dependency 
# graph induced by the test code and its dependencies and which do not
# contain duplicates.
